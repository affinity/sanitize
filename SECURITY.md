# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

The following versions of Sanitize will receive security updates when necessary. Updates _may_ be made available for older versions on a case by case basis, but this would typically depend on community contributions since maintainer time is limited.

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 5.x     | :white_check_mark: |
| 4.x     | :white_check_mark: |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

To report a security vulnerability in Sanitize, please email [ryan@wonko.com](mailto:ryan@wonko.com). Please don't PGP-encrypt your email; that's not necessary, and encrypted emails will not be read.

Expect an acknowledgement of your report within 48 hours. If the vulnerability is confirmed, every effort will be made to release a fix as soon as is practical depending on the severity and complexity of the issue. Once a solution is available, the vulnerability will be publicly disclosed and (if desired) you will be credited for finding and reporting it.
